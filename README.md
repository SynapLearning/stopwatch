# Stopwatch

- Clean, responsive and minimalist design, fit for embedding or full-screen displays.
- Local-stored, persistent state based on the URL. If you close and reopen the tab the stopwatch is still running.
- Editable and keyboard accessible. Try the `â†‘`, `â†“` and `space bar`.
- Works great with ðŸ“”[Notion](https://notion.so).
